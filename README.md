# wireshark-network-forensics
This project simulates a real-world cybersecurity investigation using Wireshark to analyze a PCAP file from a simulated network breach. Acting as a Tier 1–2 SOC Analyst, I identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), attacker behavior, and possible lateral movement across a corporate LAN environment.

# 🕵️ Wireshark Network Forensics: Detecting C2 and Lateral Movement in Simulated Breach

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world network forensics investigation. Using Wireshark, I analyzed a PCAP file from a simulated security breach to identify suspicious behavior, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and possible lateral movement. This exercise demonstrates Tier 1–2 SOC Analyst workflows for analyzing network activity and reporting findings.

## Objectives
- ✅ Detect beaconing, C2 communications, and suspicious DNS/HTTP activity  
- ✅ Identify compromised host and user  
- ✅ Analyze lateral movement (e.g., SMB/RDP)  
- ✅ Map activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (T1071, T1043, T1021)  
- ✅ Document investigation flow and IOCs  

## Environment Details
- **LAN Segment:** `10.6.13.0/24`  
- **Domain:** `massfriction[.]com`  
- **Domain Controller:** `10.6.13.3 (WIN-DQL4WFWJXQ4)`  
- **Infected Host:** `10.6.13.133 (DESKTOP-5AVE44C)`  

## MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Observed
| Technique ID | Name                                      | Description                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| T1071.001    | Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols | C2 over HTTP                  |
| T1043        | Commonly Used Port                        | Suspicious outbound traffic   |
| T1021.002    | Remote Services: SMB                      | Lateral movement via SMB      |
